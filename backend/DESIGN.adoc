= Design

We want to accept requests from the web directly, without giving the frontend access to the database whatsoever.

To do so, we'll use Cloudflare on the front-end and then manually rate-limit users with Rocket.

== Database

The database is mostly here to store each `Report` directly. The schema needs to be somewhat untyped for this work correctly. (all our types are `#[non_exhaustive]`)

However, we also want to store metadata about each report:

* Datetime submitted
* A unique identifier, not related to the created "HWID"
